/* The vacuum field — a port of ed.spiral.chat.ui.Theme's VacuumField, constant for constant.
 *
 * Not decoration painted by hand: twelve plane waves with random directions, wavelengths
 * and frequencies are summed and SQUARED, so what the dots show is a density. Islands
 * appear where the modes interfere constructively and dissolve as they beat out of phase,
 * which is why the pattern never repeats and never looks drawn. A slow swell crosses from
 * the lower-left, lifting the modes it passes over.
 *
 * Kept cheap on purpose, because a deck has to run on whatever laptop is plugged into the
 * projector: the trig is separated so it costs two multiplies per dot rather than twelve
 * cosines, dots are bucketed by brightness and drawn as batched paths, and the whole thing
 * ticks at ~30fps rather than the display rate.
